    "# Organize data teams with a RACI matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have examined data analytics from a wide vantage point and learned how organizations create teams to take advantage of their collected data. You’ve also gained some valuable career tips and resources that can help you develop your career. In this reading, you will learn more about how data teams share tasks and responsibilities through the RACI matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the duration of a data project, there are many tasks that are critical to its overall success. In large companies with global workforces, or if you’re simply new to a team, it is not always easy to determine who has specific responsibilities or manages certain tasks. To help clarify roles, many organizations have implemented the RACI matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "RACI is an acronym that comes from four classifications of involvement: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. The RACI matrix is one of many ways that companies organize roles and responsibilities. It is a visual that helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently and lists who is \"responsible,\" \"accountable,\" \"consulted,\" and \"informed\" for project tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An overview of the RACI matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "When companies employ the RACI matrix, stakeholders and cross-functional team members have a clearer understanding of involvement throughout the entire project. Although you may encounter other structural models, the RACI matrix offers you a lot of information on workplace responsibilities in a simple way. The matrix identifies and assigns project tasks to one of the following levels of engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsible**: The cross-functional team members in this role are directly responsible for performing the work necessary or make decisions that are directly related to completing a task within a project. There can be several roles or groups responsible for this task, meaning that the responsibilities are held jointly by more than one classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accountable**: Those assigned the accountable role within a task are given the job of approving the work performed by those ‘responsible’. As a general rule there is usually  a single person in this role, often a manager, or project lead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consulted: This role applies to those assigned to offer input on a task. There should be a clear and open line of two-way communication between those assigned to ‘responsible’ and ‘consulted’. There can be several people in this role. In many situations, they are referred to as subject matter experts or SMEs for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informed**: Those in this role need to be kept aware of progress and concerns of those working on a project. These responsibilities tend to be assigned to higher levels of senior leadership. They need to understand the insights from projects rather than the details of how specific tasks are performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "By labeling someone to one of these four categories, the RACI matrix helps categorize their level of involvement and proximity to each task. When you know who is involved, and at what level, it’s easier to determine who to contact if any concerns arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review of four common data professional roles\n",
    "Next, you can revisit the four common data professional roles and learn how they might perform different functions and tasks within the same project. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Scientist**: Data scientists are professionals who work closely with analytics to provide meaningful insights that help improve current business operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Engineer**: Data engineers are professionals concerned with infrastructure and are responsible for developing and managing databases. They often work alongside data scientists to build custom pipelines to manage the analysis and organization of raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analytics Team Manager**: Analytics team managers are data professionals who build and support a team of data scientists and analysts. Often they will lead a company’s analytics department. In this role, they oversee different projects to develop and implement strategies that convert raw data into business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Business Intelligence (BI) Engineer**:  Business intelligence engineers are data professionals who use their knowledge of business trends and databases to organize information and make it accessible. This role is also known as a Business Intelligence Analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task example in a RACI matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the tasks essential to any analytics project is providing access to data. This means that when you assume this role, you will help others use the available data. The RACI matrix is a way to communicate the level of accountability for this task by assigning cross-functional team members to one of the four categories: **R: Responsible, A: Accountable, C: Consulted, or I: Informed**\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "| Task | Business Intelligence Engineer | Data Scientist | Analytics Team Manager | Data Engineer | \n",
    "|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "|Access to data|R|C|R|R|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the sample RACI chart above, three of the data roles have been marked as ‘responsible’ for facilitating data accessibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "- BI engineers organize existing data and provide reports to help understand what type of data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analytics team managers develop and prioritize work streams based on business questions that can be addressed with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data engineers build custom pipelines to manage organization of and access to the raw data the team needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these roles have been assigned tasks that will provide ‘access to data’ for other team members. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that data scientists are \"consulted\" in this example. Although they are instrumental in analyzing data and providing insights, they might not take the lead in initially acquiring the data. However, they'll want to work closely with those leading the process to make sure they have data that is aligned to the business objectives and modeling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will examine how the RACI matrix can be used to communicate more information about the relationship between different roles within an organization in a future reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "In your work as a data professional, you might encounter the RACI matrix. It is a tool that many organizations use to structure their projects. It also helps to outline, communicate, and understand the responsibilities of data analytics professionals and other cross-functional team members."

    "### RACI Matrix for Data Professional Roles\n",
    "Organizations can provide a wealth of information by using a RACI matrix within data projects. The example below demonstrates how different roles may engage with common types of tasks you may encounter on a data analytics team.Tasks are assigned to four different roles. Below the chart is a key that defines each classification of involvement.\n",

    "### Definitions of the classifications of involvement\n",
    "RACI is an acronym that comes from four classifications of involvement: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsible**: This role has been assigned the task directly. They are the stakeholder who will complete the work necessary or make decisions. More than one role can be responsible for a task. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accountable**: This role is the owner of the work. They will need to approve the job when the task is complete. This role makes sure that responsibilities are complete. This is most often a single person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consulted**: This role is expected to give input during the process. Most often, the people in these classifications are subject matter experts (or SMEs). Communication is two-way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informed**: People or stakeholders who need to be involved. They need updates on progress or decisions, but they do not need to be formally consulted, nor do they contribute directly to the task or decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current tasks are being assigned in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create Models to Analyze Data, Drive insights and recommendations Based on Data**: Data scientists are often tasked with building statistical models to analyze data. BI engineers may be consulted to help understand inputs and outputs of the models, while analytic team managers may offer input about the business rationale for developing the model and desired insights.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expanding Roles and Responsibilities with a RACI example\n",
    "Referring back to the previous RACI chart, the task access to data is marked as consulted, informed or responsible for our current four roles. The four data team roles identified on this chart are examples of titles that you will work closely with on a regular day basis. Now it’s time to consider who is accountable for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explore how all four classifications of interactivity function within the RACI matrix, an additional executive-level role is included on the chart below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chief Data Officer**: in charge of consistency, accuracy, relevancy, interpretability, and reliability of the data a team provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be some tasks that will require more senior stakeholder engagement. One of those tasks being to ensure that data used in analysis is compliant with industry standards and regulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure Data Compliance**: Team members responsible for making sure that the organization follows protocols and legal requirements of data stewardship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RACI Matrix for Data Professional Roles\n",
    "In this chart below, the data professional roles and tasks have been expanded.\n",

    "|Drive insights and recommendations based on data|C|R|C|I|\n",
    "|Ensure Data Compliance|C|I|C|R|A|\n",
    "\n",
    "With an executive level role (Chief Data Officer) and the final task ensure data compliance added, you can now consider how the accountable designation works. Tasks that are assigned an accountable label are most often assigned to a single person who has the obligation to ensure this task is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the task of access to data in this project is the direct responsibility of other team members, the company’s Chief Data Officer is accountable–meaning this role holds the ultimate responsibility for ensuring this task is completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind this is just one hypothetical example; each organization and team will have their own preferences for how tasks are assigned to members of the team, each with their own roles and responsibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Benefits of the RACI Matrix\n",
    "-Allows easier workload analysis for teams and individuals\n",
    "-Helps ensure that critical processes are not overlooked\n",
    "-Allows new team members to quickly identify roles and responsibilities\n",
    "-Streamlines project and task management\n",
    "-Enables cross-team communication\n",
